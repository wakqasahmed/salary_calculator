##Storyline

Ahmed works as an accountant, and gets paid $10/hr. He can earn extra $1.50/hr overtime (over 8 hrs in a day) and extra $2.50/hr for hours beyond 40 in any one week. He also can get a bonus of 125% for working on Friday and 50% bonus for working on Saturday. Bonuses for Friday and Saturday are calculated based on the hours worked on those days, they are not used to calculate the bonus for working more than 40 hours in a week.

Given the number of hours Ahmed worked each day Sunday, Monday...Saturday, create a JavaScript based program to compute his salary for the week. Input will be 7 numbers separated by spaces.
